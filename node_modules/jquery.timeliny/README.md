#Timeliny
-----------

Timeliny is a responsive jQuery plugin for creating year-based interactive timelines.

What you are looking for is in the `/dist/` folder.

#### Demo
[See demo page](https://maoosi.github.io/jquery.timeliny).

#### Dependencies
It expects jQuery 2.x to work: https://github.com/jquery/jquery

#### Compatibility
Recent browsers such as :
IE 10+, Opera, Safari, Firefox & Chrome.


##Installation
-----------

**Using NPM:**

```bash
npm install jquery.timeliny
```

**Including files:**

The following example includes files located into the dist folder. Using the minified files is recommended.

```html
<!-- Before closing your <head> tag -->
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="jquery.timeliny.min.css" />

<!-- Before closing your <body> tag -->
<script src="jquery.timeliny.min.js"></script>
```

##Usage
-----------

**Create the basic html structure required. Don't forget `data-year` and to set an `active` element:**

```html
<div id="example1">
	<div data-year="2014" class="active">Short text here</div>
	<div data-year="2011">Short text here</div>
	<div data-year="2010">Short text here</div>
</div>
```

**Then, all you need to do is call the plugin inside a $(document).ready function:**

```js
$(function() {
	$('#example1').timeliny();
});
```

**A more complex initialization with all options set could look like this:**

```js
$(function() {
	$('#example1').timeliny({
		order: 'asc',
		className: 'timeliny',
		wrapper: '<div class="timeliny-wrapper"></div>',
		boundaries: 2,
		animationSpeed: 250,
		onInit: function() {},
		onDestroy: function() {},
		afterLoad: function(currYear) {},
		onLeave: function(currYear, nextYear) {},
		afterChange: function(currYear) {},
		afterResize: function() {}
	});
});
```

|-----------------|------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| order           | `asc`                                    | Specifies that the results should be returned in ascending order. For returning the results in a descending order, set the option to `desc`.                                                                                                       |
| className       | `timeliny`                               | Specifies the CSS class name to use for the instanciated element. If you change this option, you will also need to change the default class name in the Css.                                                                                       |
| wrapper         | `<div class="timeliny-wrapper"></div>`   | Specifies the structure of the main wrapper element. Useful if you use a grid system. Example with Foundation grid: `<div class="row"><div class="small-12 columns"></div></div>`.                                                                 |
| boundaries      | `2`                                      | Specifies the amount of 'ghost' dots/years to add on both sides of your timeline. For example, if your timeline contain years from 2002 to 2005 and boundaries is set to `2`, timeliny will transform your timeline from 2000 to 2007.             |
| animationSpeed  | `250`                                    | Specifies the animation speed for transition from one date to another one.                                                                                                                                                                         |
